# Number-Guessing-Game
 A simple number guessing game made from Python

The computer will generate a random number from 1 to 100. 

You need to guess the number and on the basis of your guess, the computer will suggest to guess a lower/higher number.

Once the number is guessed correctly, you will get your score on the base of how many guesses it took.

There is also a C version available!
